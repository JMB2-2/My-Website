                <h1>About Bean & Brew</h1>
                <p>Bean & Brew is a small, family-owned coffee shop built around a passion for high-quality, beautifully crafted coffee. 
                    Using professional barista machines and ethically sourced beans, we create drinks that are as aesthetic as they are delicious — 
                    from classic favourites to trend-led options like matcha and specialty lattes. We pride ourselves on being inclusive and accessible to everyone, 
                    offering a wide range of gluten-free, vegetarian and vegan options without compromising on flavour or quality.
                    More than just a café, Bean & Brew is a community space that welcomes students, families, busy professionals and creatives alike. 
                    Our carefully designed space and latte art have made us a favourite among social media content creators, and we actively encourage customers to share, review and celebrate their experiences with us. 
                    Recognised with awards such as Best Community Coffee Shop, Café Design of the Year and Good Food Award Winner, Bean & Brew stands out as a place where great coffee, creativity and community come together.
