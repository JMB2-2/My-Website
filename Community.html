                <h1>Our Social Media Status</h1>
                <p>Bean & Brew is proud to be a space where creativity and community meet. 
                    We actively welcome social media creators, photographers and content makers who love to share beautiful coffee moments, 
                    cozy interiors and latte art with their audiences. From aesthetic flat-lays to behind-the-scenes barista shots, 
                    we encourage creators to showcase their work and tag us so we can celebrate, share and promote their content across our own platforms.
                    At the heart of Bean & Brew is a diverse and welcoming community. On any given day, you’ll find social media creators capturing content, 
                    busy professionals grabbing coffee on the go, students settling in with laptops, local families enjoying time together, and elderly 
                    regulars stopping by for their daily chat and familiar cup. This blend of people and stories is what makes our café more than just 
                    a place for great coffee — it’s a shared space where everyone belongs.
